# Issues
* The original fonts were damaged by the extraction process.
* `Source\Bethesda\Shared\AS3\BSScrollingList.as`:  Figure out which variable(s) are used between `bAllowWheelScrollNoSelectionChange` & `bAllowSelectionDisabledListNav`.
* The `PipboyMenu.swf` uses a version of `Shared\AS3\BSScrollingList.as` with an additional boolean variable called `bAllowSelectionDisabledListNav`.
* PipboyMenu could possibly use finer tweaking of the page header textfields. Its pretty dang close already though.
* HUDMenu ammo counter seems messed up. Incorrect counting.
